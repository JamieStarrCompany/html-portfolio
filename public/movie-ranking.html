<h1> Adam Narain's Favourite Films</h1>
<h2>These 3 are my current favourites</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
<p>Yes, I do love Wes Anderson's films, but this is special for me. It's the characters in this film that make the visual spectle worth it. Also the ending always gets me excited, no matter how many times i've seen it</p>
<h3>Django Unchained</h3>
<p>For me it is a 2 part novel. Part one stops at winter and Part to is the acursed candy land</p>
<h3>Be Kind Rewind</h3>
<p>I love an underdog story. Never has an underdog story been so sweetly told. It always makes me emotional</p>
